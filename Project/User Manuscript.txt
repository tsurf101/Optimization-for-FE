User Manuscript for utility strategy back-testing system

In order to run the back-test:
(1) Excute scenario_generator_with_copula.R (or scenario_generator_with_copula_pca.R) to generate a set of .csv file in the current directory. 
	(e.g. 100.csv, 120.csv, etc)
(2) Run multi-period.m, the module will plot the net-value series and store other detail information in file "result.csv"
(3) Wait about 20 minutes to see the full result. 
	If you cannot wait for so long, change the Line 4 in multi-period.m 
		"for gamma = 0.1:0.1:0.9" into "for gamma = 0.3"
(4) Open "result.csv" to see net-valus's changes, transaction costs and more analysis.
